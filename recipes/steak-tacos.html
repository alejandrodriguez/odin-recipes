            <h1>Grilled flank steak and avocado soft tacos</h1>
            <img src="../images/steak-tacos.jpg" alt="Delicious steak tacos being prepared to eat.">
            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This amazing combination of grilled flank steak, peppers, scallions and (yes!) avocado makes a super-flavorful weeknight supper or party dish. In addition to adding a smoky flavor to the avocado, grilling the avocado makes them extra creamy. If you want char marks on the tortillas, donâ€™t wrap them in foil. Lay them in a single layer on grill until heated and grill marks appear.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Off heat, coat grill rack or grill pan with nonstick spray. Preheat gas grill or grill pan to medium-high, or prepare medium-high fire in charcoal grill.</li>
                    <li>Stack tortillas and wrap in foil. In small bowl, combine granulated garlic, salt, chile powder, and cumin. Halve, pit, and peel avocado. Brush cut sides of avocado halves with 1/2 tsp oil and sprinkle with 1/4 tsp spice blend.</li>
                    <li>Core and seed bell peppers. Slice each into 6 rings and transfer to large bowl. Halve scallions crosswise and add to peppers. Drizzle vegetables with remaining 1 tsp oil and toss with 1 tsp spice blend. Rub remaining spice blend all over steak.</li>
                    <li>Transfer packet of tortillas to grill. Arrange steak, vegetables, and avocado on grill. Grill vegetables and avocado until charred, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to plate. Grill steak to desired doneness, 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steak to cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. Slice steak very thinly against grain.</li>
                    <li>Cut each avocado half into 6 pieces and mash 1 piece down center of each tortilla. On each tortilla, layer 1 pepper ring, 2 scallion pieces, and about 1 oz steak. Garnish with onion, cheese, and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges and hot sauce.</li>

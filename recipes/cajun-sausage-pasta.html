                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 pound pork sausage (ideally smoked)</li>
                    <li>5 ounces white mushrooms</li>
                    <li>4 cloves garlic minced</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes</li>
                    <li>1/2 red bell pepper</li>
                    <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
                    <li>2 cups half-and-half</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning</li>
                    <li>3 cups uncooked penne</li>
                    <li>8 leaves fresh basil</li>
                    <li>Salt & pepper</li>
                    <li>Freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add olive oil and sausage to a soup pot over medium-high heat. Brown the sausages for 5 minutes. If your sausages are particularly fatty, drain most of the grease off.</li>
                <li>Add the mushrooms and saut√© for another 3 minutes or so.</li>
                <li>Stir in the garlic, Dijon mustard, sun-dried tomatoes, and red pepper. Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add in the chicken broth, half-and-half, Cajun seasoning, and penne. Increase the heat to high. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to medium (or medium-low if it continues to bubble a lot). Cook until the pasta is done and the sauce is reduced to your liking (about 20 minutes), stirring often so the pasta doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan.</li>
                <li>Season with salt & pepper and stir in the basil. Top with freshly grated parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
            </ol>
